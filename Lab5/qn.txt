1. Create list of list to store set of words. Write a recursive function to check every word is palindrome

or not. Include a recursive function in another separate module by receiving list item as an argument.

2. Create a module called STACK to include the stack (consider tuple) data structure operation

(push,pop,isempty). Include appropriate user defined function for each stack operation in STACK

module. Write a recursive function to reverse the given stack content in another module.

3. Create a List with N number of numerical values. Sort the list elements in ascending order using merge

sort. (don’t use built in function). Include a recursive function for merge sort in process module. Print

the sorted list normal module.

4. Distance value is represented in terms of feet and inch. Create a nested dictionary to store
distance value (feet and inch) for 5 distances. Outer dictionary key value as 1,2,3,..... Get the
input from the user. Include the following user defined functions:
a. Average () – find the average of 5 distance
b. Add_distance() – add any two distances among 5 distances(based on outer
dictionary key value)
c. Maximum() – find the maximum among 5 distances. 

5. Create a nested dictionary to store N student details such as rno,name,dept,marks(list of 5
subjects),credits(list of 5 subjcets). Assum rno is the key value in outer dictionary. Calcullate
each student SGPA and CGPA and update for each student in nested dictionary.
